# Visualizing Geospatial Time Series Data

Publicly-available individual-level mobility data is an artifact of the ubiquitous cell phone.  

Because the data is enormous, any profitable study of it must begin with a visualization.

My favorite visualization approach comes from a company called [(Tectonix)](https://www.tectonix.com/).

To appreciate their approach, consider an interest in spreader events.

During a spreader event, a group of people gathers in space and time and then spreads out from that point, taking whatever they've caught--or learned--along the way.  

Where did the group come from?  Where do they go after the event?

To see how a good visualization can answer these questions, check out this [(video)](https://twitter.com/tectonixgeo/status/1242628347034767361).

# Emulating the Tectonix Approach

I recommend licensing their software.  However, if you already have mobility data, you can make good progress toward their approach with two simplifying ideas.  The first simplifying idea is "Meaningful Ticks."  The second is "Intelligent Javascript."
